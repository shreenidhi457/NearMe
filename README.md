                Puzhal Lake, also called Red Hills Lake, is a crucial rain-fed reservoir near Chennai, India, serving as a primary water source for the city alongside Chembarambakkam Lake, known for its natural beauty, sunrise/sunset views, and peaceful atmosphere for walks, though it faces challenges like siltation and pollution impacting its storage capacity and water quality. Built in the 19th century, its storage capacity was significantly increased in the 1990s to meet growing demands, making it vital for local groundwater recharge and the city's water supply, especially during dry spells.
